# Complaint-Management-System

This project is developed solely by Rahul Agarwal.
This project is based on CMS - Complaint Management System.
Currently the project consists of a single page and is device friendly , i.e. it is responsive.
Languages used in the project are HTML, CSS, Javascript and framework such as Bootstrap.
The CMS is under development and is made for my personal practice and to polish my skills.
